For a while now I’ve been interested in minimalism. This philosophy is based on keeping in your life the things that benefit you and getting rid of the things that don't add value to your day to day life. This struck a cord inside me and I quickly tried to learn how to start implementing it to my life.

Now more than ever our attention is constantly sought after and I want to get rid of as many distractions as possible. That's why I chose to disable most of the notifications I can receive on my phone.

On social media it’s quite easy to feel the fear of missing out (FOMO), regardless of what your feed look like. That’s why I wanted my phone and laptop wallpapers to have some kind words to try and quiet down my FOMO or just remind me of what's important for me. I also wanted some geometrical shapes to fill them a bit more. That’s how I came up with a small minimalist wallpapers generator. Even though it is quite basic it’s enough for me and I can use it to have numerous wallpapers that meet my needs.

If you want to play with it <a href="/tools/minimalist-wallpapers-generator/" target="_blank">here it is</a>.
