## Introduction

My first experience with a Pok√©mon game was in 2006. I remember playing Pok√©mon Fire Red on a Gameboy Advance SP in a video game store while my parents were grocery shopping. Of course every week some kid started a new game and I kept doing the beginning of the game over and over. You can say I was ecstatic when I was gifted Pok√©mon Emerald and got to play my first real adventure in a Pok√©mon world.

When growing up, I got to play other video games but somehow it seemed I would always come back to playing Pok√©mon Emerald, starting a new game every year or so.

Recently I started once again a new game, this time on an emulator so that I didn‚Äôt need to pack my GBA everywhere (I still kept the cartridge out of nostalgia). This time the more I played the more I felt frustrated with some of the game features. For example, I have never ever traded Pok√©mons with friends, so I never got to complete my Pok√©dex as some Pok√©mons can only evolve through trading. Another thing is that PP Ups can't be bought with money, and it bothered me that I couldn't max out my Pok√©mons moves when farming XP. 

These are only a few things that bothered me, the more I kept playing the more I found little things that could be improved for a either a better game experience or a better game logic.

A year or so ago, I watched a YouTube video about how a guy modified the game so that it had the first Pok√©mon of its team follow him like in Pok√©mon Heartgold and Soulsilver (for the curious it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tpBooD_X7k&pp=ygUicG9rZW1vbiBlbWVyYWxkIHBva2Vtb24gZm9sbG93IHlvdQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">this video</a>). Naturally, being a developer I thought "if this guy did it, why can't I adapt the game to my needs?". And that is exactly what I did, I resolved my frustations one at a time.

## Setting up the project

Thanks to the <a href="https://pret.github.io" target="_blank">team Pret guys</a>, Pok√©mon Emerald has been decompiled and put on Github in <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald" target="_blank">this repository</a>. I just had to fork the project and set it up on my computer to be ready to change the game. Their installation documentation is quite thorough, I just created a script and a Docker compose file to be up and running more efficiently (and be more OS-agnostic)

If you want to do the same thing you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald" target="_blank">repository</a> and create a few files in the base folder:

```dockerfile title=Dockerfile copy=true
FROM debian:12-slim

RUN apt update && apt install -y build-essential binutils-arm-none-eabi git libpng-dev gdebi-core wget
RUN wget https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman && chmod +x ./install-devkitpro-pacman && echo "Y" | ./install-devkitpro-pacman
RUN git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc

WORKDIR /agbcc

RUN chmod +x build.sh install.sh
RUN ./build.sh
RUN ./install.sh /pokeemerald
```

```yaml title=docker-compose.yaml copy=true
services:
  pokemaker:
    container_name: pokemaker
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/pokeemerald
    command: tail -f /dev/null
```

```bash title=build.sh copy=true
#!/bin/bash

docker compose up -d
docker exec -it pokemaker /bin/bash -c "cd /pokeemerald && make"
```

Now all you have to do is run `./build.sh` to build the game (the compilation part happens in the Docker container).

## My adaptations to the game

### Translation

This project is a decompilation of the English version of the game. I am French and I grew up playing the French version of Pok√©mon. Even though I do speak English now, I'm still used to the French Pok√©mons names, same thing for their moves, abilities and natures. So that's the first thing I changed. It is not difficult to change the text, it is just tedious. The files will look like this:

```c title=src/data/text/species_names.h
const u8 gSpeciesNames[][POKEMON_NAME_LENGTH + 1] = {
  [SPECIES_NONE] = _("??????????"),
  [SPECIES_BULBASAUR] = _("BULBASAUR"), // [!code --]
  [SPECIES_IVYSAUR] = _("IVYSAUR"), // [!code --]
  [SPECIES_VENUSAUR] = _("VENUSAUR"), // [!code --]
  ...
  [SPECIES_BULBASAUR] = _("BULBIZARRE"), // [!code ++]
  [SPECIES_IVYSAUR] = _("HERBIZARRE"), // [!code ++]
  [SPECIES_VENUSAUR] = _("FLORIZARRE"), // [!code ++]
  ...
};
```

```c title=src/data/text/nature_names.h
static const u8 sHardyNatureName[] = _("HARDY"); // [!code --]
static const u8 sLonelyNatureName[] = _("LONELY"); // [!code --]
static const u8 sHardyNatureName[] = _("HARDI"); // [!code ++]
static const u8 sLonelyNatureName[] = _("SOLO"); // [!code ++]
...
```

```c title=src/data/text/move_names.h
const u8 gMoveNames[MOVES_COUNT][MOVE_NAME_LENGTH + 1] =
{
  [MOVE_NONE] = _("-"),
  [MOVE_POUND] = _("POUND"), // [!code --]
  [MOVE_KARATE_CHOP] = _("KARATE CHOP"), // [!code --]
  [MOVE_POUND] = _("ECRAS'FACE"), // [!code ++]
  [MOVE_KARATE_CHOP] = _("POING-KARATE"), // [!code ++]
  ...
};
```

```c title=src/data/text/abilities.h
static const u8 sNoneDescription[] = _("No special ability."); // [!code --]
static const u8 sStenchDescription[] = _("Helps repel wild Pok√©mon."); // [!code --]
...
static const u8 sNoneDescription[] = _("Pas de talent."); // [!code ++]
static const u8 sStenchDescription[] = _("Repousse Pok√©mon sauvage."); // [!code ++]
```

A few hundred translations is what it took for me to get a basic enjoyment of the modified game. Now I have a bastardised version of the game where all the text is in English except for the Pok√©mons names, moves, abilities and natures, but it doesn't bother me at all.

### Removing the overwrite save confirmation dialog

This one is a tiny teeny frustration. But it is one of the first things I changed to get me acquainted with the project files. 

![Overwrite save confirmation dialog](../../assets/blog/2024-08-27_how-I-adapted-pokemon-emerald-to-my-needs/save-overwrite-confirmation.png)

When you overwrite a save file, the game asks you to confirm. I found that kind of annoying, so I removed it.

```c title=src/start_menu.c
...
static u8 SaveFileExistsCallback(void)
{
  if (gDifferentSaveFile == TRUE)
  {
    ShowSaveMessage(gText_DifferentSaveFile, SaveConfirmOverwriteDefaultNoCallback);
  }
  else
  {
    ShowSaveMessage(gText_AlreadySavedFile, SaveConfirmOverwriteCallback); // [!code --]
    sSaveDialogCallback = SaveSavingMessageCallback; // [!code ++]
  }
  return SAVE_IN_PROGRESS;
}
...
```

Instead of asking me if I really want to overwrite my save file, it now just skip to the saving message and the actual saving of the game.

### Allow PP Ups buying

Like I said in the [introduction](#introduction), in the end-game, it is frustrating to not be able to max out my Pok√©mons moves PPs. Luckily, it is very easy to change. I decided to only have the Battle Frontier Pok√©mart sell PP Ups (as it is supposed to be where the best trainers are, might as well give them the best items to buy). It only takes a line of code to add PP Ups to the list of sold items by this Pok√©mart.

```plaintext title=data/maps/BattleFrontier_Mart/scripts.inc
BattleFrontier_Mart_Pokemart:
	.2byte ITEM_ULTRA_BALL
	.2byte ITEM_HYPER_POTION
	.2byte ITEM_MAX_POTION
	.2byte ITEM_PP_UP // [!code ++]
  ...
```

Each line represent an item that can be bought at the Pok√©mart. Later on, I decided to have this specific Pok√©mart sell numerous more items, useful for battling of completing the Pok√©dex more easily. These are the items that I decided to add :

- All the evolution stones
- Deep Sea Tooth & Deep Sea Scale (‚ÇΩ10,000 each)
- All the TMs
- Ether (‚ÇΩ2,500) & Max Ether (‚ÇΩ5,000)
- Elixir (‚ÇΩ5,000) & Max Elixir (‚ÇΩ10,000)

You can see that I also changed the price the Ethers and Elixirs are sold for. I chose to do that because I thought that they were quite underpriced compared to their actual value. To do so is quite simple, I just needed to change the price in the items header file, for example for the Ether:

```c title=src/data/items.h
...
[ITEM_ETHER] =
   {
    .name = _("ETHER"),
    .itemId = ITEM_ETHER,
    .price = 1200, // [!code --]
    .price = 2500, // [!code ++]
    .holdEffectParam = 10,
    .description = sEtherDesc,
    .pocket = POCKET_ITEMS,
    .type = ITEM_USE_PARTY_MENU,
    .fieldUseFunc = ItemUseOutOfBattle_PPRecovery,
    .battleUsage = ITEM_B_USE_MEDICINE,
    .battleUseFunc = ItemUseInBattle_PPRecovery,
},
...
```

A little fun fact is that this file sets the Master Ball price to 0, making it quite literally priceless and so unsellable.

### Trade with myself

Growing up, I never traded Pok√©mons to get some of them to evolve so I never completed the Pok√©dex. And now in 2024, good luck finding someone to trade with. The solution to that is simple: finding a way to trade with myself. It is a bit harder to implement though. <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/goto/post?id=10215480" target="_blank">TheMaxan on pokecommunity.com</a> provided a great way to achieve this. Kudos to them!

The first step is to find an NPC (non-playable character) that is not crucial for the game story completion. I chose the "Fat Man" (that's not me, it is how he's called in the source code ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) in Littleroot Town.

![Fat Man in Littleroot Town](../../assets/blog/2024-08-27_how-I-adapted-pokemon-emerald-to-my-needs/fat-man.png)

Now we have to change its dialog script to make him ask me if I want to trade with myself using the script written by TheMaxan.

```c title=data/maps/LittlerootTown/scripts.inc
LittlerootTown_EventScript_FatMan::
	msgbox LittlerootTown_Text_CanUsePCToStoreItems, MSGBOX_NPC // [!code --]
	goto SCRIPT_SelfTrade_V1 // [!code ++]
	end

SCRIPT_SelfTrade_V1:: // [!code ++]
	lock // [!code ++]
	faceplayer // [!code ++]
	msgbox SCRIPT_SelfTrade_Text_IllTradeIfYouWant, MSGBOX_YESNO // [!code ++]
	compare VAR_RESULT, NO // [!code ++] 
	goto_if_eq SCRIPT_SelfTrade_DeclineTrade // [!code ++]
	special ChoosePartyMon // [!code ++]
	waitstate // [!code ++]
	compare VAR_0x8004, 255 // [!code ++]
	goto_if_eq SCRIPT_SelfTrade_DeclineTrade // [!code ++]
	copyvar VAR_0x8005, VAR_0x8004 // [!code ++]
	setvar VAR_0x8004, 6 // [!code ++]
	special CreateInGameTradePokemon // [!code ++]
	special DoInGameTradeScene // [!code ++]
	waitstate // [!code ++]
	msgbox SCRIPT_SelfTrade_Text_ComeBack, MSGBOX_DEFAULT // [!code ++]
	release // [!code ++]
	end // [!code ++]
...
```

I didn't include the other scripts that are part of the self-trade, these ones handle the dialog flow (yes/no) and the dialog boxes. 

```c
special ChoosePartyMon
```

The `ChoosePartyMon` function is a special macro that loads the screen asking the player to choose a Pok√©mon in their team. It returns the index of the Pok√©mon they chose in the `VAR_0x8004` buffer adress. If they didn't choose any Pok√©mon (ie: exited the screen), it will return `255`.

```c
compare VAR_0x8004, 255
goto_if_eq SCRIPT_SelfTrade_DeclineTrade
copyvar VAR_0x8005, VAR_0x8004
setvar VAR_0x8004, 6
```

This next bit is a conditional that checks if the `VAR_0x8004` value is `255`. If it is then we load a dialog the indicate that the player has declined the trade. Otherwise we copy the `VAR_0x8004` value to `VAR_0x8005` and set `VAR_0x8004` to `6` (it is an indicator to say that the player did a trade with themselves).

```c title=src/trade.c
...
void CreateInGameTradePokemon(void)
{
  CreateInGameTradePokemonInternal(gSpecialVar_0x8005, gSpecialVar_0x8004); // [!code --]
  if(gSpecialVar_0x8004 == 6) // [!code ++]
    gEnemyParty[0] = gPlayerParty[gSpecialVar_0x8005]; // [!code ++]
  else // [!code ++]
    CreateInGameTradePokemonInternal(gSpecialVar_0x8005, gSpecialVar_0x8004); // [!code ++]
}
...
```

Here we are inside the function handling the Pok√©mon trade. If the `VAR_0x8004` value is `6` then we set the Pok√©mon of the trade partner to the chosen Pok√©mon in our team, effectively making the player trade with themselves. Otherwise we load the normal trade process.

### Conclusion

These are just a few things I changed to make the game more enjoyable for me. I made other changes, and I might share them in a future blog post. It has been a really fun experience to tinker with my favourite game and see the actual results of my coding.
